# Harpo Cryptographic Application

## Description
Harpo is a cryptographic application written in C++ using the Qt framework. It provides a user-friendly graphical interface for encrypting and decrypting messages using a hybrid encryption scheme combining AES and RSA algorithms. Harpo aims to ensure data security and confidentiality while maintaining ease of use for the end user.
